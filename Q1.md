Project : Corona virus and it’s consequences
================

## Final Project

## Assignment 1 - exploration of cases and concern data sets.

We would want to explore the data we received by the 5 core activities
of data analysis that we learned in class.

Our question is of type exploratory - we would want to check if there
are some relations between the different data sets we received.

We received the data sets:

-   Covid cases data set.

-   Concern data set.

-   Trump Tweets.

Our first assignment is to explore the data, so we would want to start
with that.<br/>We will explore the data by doing some statistical
analysis and plots for a better understanding, and for last we will try
to present the results as best as we can.

### Installations

**Note:** We have turned off the comments issued by the chunk, because
they are only prints of the system and irrelevant

``` r
# install.packages("rtweet")
# install.packages("tidytext")
# install.packages("robotstxt")
# install.packages("lexicon")
# install.packages("stringr")
# install.packages("reshape")
#install.packages("multipanelfigure")
```

### Libraries

## **Q1**

### Scraping the data and organize it

Here is a link to the site from which the information on the corona
cases was taken  
“<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data/United_States_medical_cases>”
<br>

First we check if the site allows us to access the table and perform
web-scraping
