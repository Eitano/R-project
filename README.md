### The project has 3 parts:

1) Exploration of COVID concern and COVID cases

2) Exploration of Donald Trump’s tweets during the concern poll. Can tweets be predictive of COVID concern? For that I generated a hypothesis based on the exploration. Then, I build a machine learning model that uses Trump’s tweets as the explanatory variable and concern as response (predicted) variable.
Using k-fold cross validation to show model success in terms of pearson's R.

3) A meaningful question:
Is academic achievement could help predict country chance to deal with coronavirus. 

### Data sources: 
- Covid concern which scraped from wiki covid data 
- Trump tweets.
